    <div id="introduce">
        Good afternoon Sir,
        Thank you for giving me 
        this opportunity to introduce myself.
        I'm Neeraj Kumar. I am currently pursuing my 4th-year 
        B.Tech in Information Technology Stream from 
        CVR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, with an overall cgpa of 9.1
        Coming to my technical background, I am familiar 
        with  Java and python.Mostly I will go with Java 
        and sometimes I will choose a language based on 
        the problem statement given.I am also familiar 
        with database languages such as MySQL, Mongodb.
        I have also learnt some technologies such as Angular,React, 
        JSP,Servlets.I have done a few projects during these 3 
        years such as Carpooling application website where 
        we had used angular framework.I have also participated 
        in some team contests such as Virtusa Hackathon.I 
        am also a part of Student Club where I am head of 
        Web Development Club.My short-term goal is to get placed 
        in a reputed company where I can have more opportunity 
        to grow not only technically but also personally.
        And my long-term goal is to prove myself as best 
        in whatever field by grabbing every opportunity I get 
        and grow along with the company 
        This is pretty much about myself.
        Thank you Sir.

    <div id="project">
        An application where users can share rides with someone
        going their way.The project was done with a team of 5 members. 
        It was a 15 days task. 3 members worked on frontend 
        and 2 were on backend, I took frontend role in the part of the 
        project because i am intrested in designing UI, 
        where we had used AngularJS as frontend. 
        There were some errors/bugs in our project 
        so it took some time to detect all of those.
        Though it was a tricky part to make the project in 
        less time but all together made it successfully.

    <div id="hire">
        My 3 years of involvement with the education industry 
        has led to my intense understanding of the area.
        This is a wonderful opportunity for me to get interviewed 
        at such a renowned company.Your organization will surely 
        prove to be an excellent platform for me to 
        establish my skills and knowledge 
        in the corporate world.
        Even though I am a fresher, I assure you that 
        I will give my best and work to my full potential 
        so that I can contribute as much as 
        I can towards the growth and welfare of this great brand.

    <div id="subject">
        The subject i felt difficult was software engineering
        because mostly it was theoretical rather than practical.
        At first It was intresting about how models can be prepared 
        in different ways.Then after it was mostly theory.
        The syllabus also looks like To be out depth.
        So we planned to study somewhat early and referred many 
        sites and youtube channels.We also learnt some topics 
        which were out of syllabus, but atlast we cleared it.
    </div>
    <div id="situation">
        In my inter 2nd year, After the declaration of JEE-Mains
        results,I felt really bad about myself because i didn't get
        a good rank to qualify for NIT/IIT Colleges.But I cheered
        up myself to get good rank so that I can get a good rank
        in EAMCET.
